## Reflection

I set out to build my a project that could utilize RESTful API to integrate data from OpenWeather API. I also wanted to make the project with the React.js library, therefore I used the 'create-react-app' boilerplate. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was effectively styling the forecast display for usability. Additionally, carrying endpoints from development to production and deployment was a valuable learning process.
