 
## Weather

Welcome to the Weather app! This is a web application built with React that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city in the world. The app is connected to the OpenWeather API, which provides real-time weather data for over 200,000 cities around the world.

To get started with the app, first make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. Then, clone this repository and run npm install in the root directory to install all the necessary dependencies.

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the app by running npm start. This will launch the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/.

To use the app, simply enter a zip code in the search bar and press the "Search" button. The app will display the current weather conditions for that city.

The OpenWeather React app is a great example of how to build a web application that leverages an API to provide real-time data to users. We hope you find it useful and informative! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

## Reflection

I set out to build my a project that could utilize RESTful API to integrate data from OpenWeather API. I also wanted to make the project with the React.js library, therefore I used the 'create-react-app' boilerplate. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was effectively styling the forecast display for usability. Additionally, carrying endpoints from development to production and deployment was a valuable learning process.
